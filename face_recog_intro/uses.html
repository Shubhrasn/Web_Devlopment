                   <p>Face recognition is currently being used to instantly identify when known shoplifters, organized retail criminals or people with a history of fraud enter retail establishments. Photographs of individuals can be matched against large databases of criminals so that loss prevention and retail security professionals can be instantly notified when a shopper enters a store that prevents a threat. Face recognition systems are already radically reducing retail crime. According to our data, face recognition reduces external shrink by 34% and, more importantly, reduces violent incidents in retail stores by up to 91%</p>

                   <p>In China, there is a financial services company called Ant Financial that enables customers to pay for meals by scanning their faces. Customers place orders through a digital menu, and then use face scan as a payment option. After providing their telephone number they can then purchase their meal.</p>

                   <h2 class="card-title text-center">PROTECT LAW ENFORCEMENT</h2>
                   <p>Mobile face recognition apps, like the one offered by FaceFirst, are already helping police officers by helping them instantly identify individuals in the field from a safe distance. This can help by giving them contextual data that tells them who they are dealing with and whether they need to proceed with caution. As an example, if a police officer pulls over a wanted murderer at a routine traffic stop, the officer would instantly know that the suspect may be armed and dangerous, and could call for reinforcement.</p>

                   <h2 class="card-title text-center">FIND MISSING PERSONS</h2>
                   <p>Face recognition can be used to find missing children and victims of human trafficking. As long as missing individuals are added to a database, law enforcement can become alerted as soon as they are recognized by face recognitionâ€”be it an airport, retail store or other public space. In fact, 3000 missing children were discovered in just four days using face recognition in India!</p>
